        <div class="card-text">

            <p>This policy applies to all <a href="/regional">CubingUSA Regional Championships</a>.</p>

            <p>Podium (first, second, and third place) and accompanying awards at Regional and State Championships are open to all competitors regardless of residency.</p>

            <p><strong>Regional Champion</strong> titles are granted to the top competitor in each event with an eligible residency.</p>

            <h3>Declare Residency</h3>

            <p><a href="/login">Log in</a> and <a href="/edit">select your residency</a> before the declaration deadline (typically the night before the competition starts) to be eligible for Regional Champion titles.</p>

            <p>You can change your residency if you move, but you may only be eligible for Regional Champion titles at one Regional per calendar year.</p>

            <p>You may still attend and win awards and place on the podium at Regional Championships where are you not eligible for Regional Champion titles.</p>

            <h3>Bring Proof of Residency</h3>

            <p>In addition to declaring in advance, you will need to bring proof of residency to the event to claim a Regional Champion title.</p>

            <p>Note that title eligibility is based on residency, not citizenship.</p>

            <p>Proof of residency may be in two forms: Proof of residency for the competitor Proof of residency for the competitor&rsquo;s parent or guardian, with a statement from the parent or guardian that the competitor lives with them.</p>
