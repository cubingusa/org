  <h3>Competition Policies</h3>
  <p>
    This page lists a number of competition policies which may differ from what you are used to at local competitions.
  </p>
  <h5>General</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>All competitors, other than those only competing in Fewest Moves and Multi Blind, should attend a briefing before their first round begins on Saturday or Sunday.</li>
    <li>All rounds will be stationary.</li>
    <li>Competitors will be called up to the green room one group before their event starts. We are using a single scramble set for all semifinals, and we will not be able to start without everyone present. While in the green room, competitors may only use phones if all data transmission is off (airplane mode, no wifi, no bluetooth).</li>
    <li>If competitors interact with their phones during the round, we reserve the right to inspect them, to ensure that they are not receiving outside information.</li>
    <li>Headphones with wireless capability may not be used.</li>
    <li>Competitors may not watch other competitors solving.</li>
    <li>We may hold cubes at the scrambling table in order to have competitors complete their attempts at a similar time.</li>
    <li>During the round, competition timers may only be used for official attempts.</li>
    <li>Do not reset your timer, let the judge do this after your result has been processed by data entry.</li>
    <li>Regulation A3b1 will be enforced for all rounds, and a penalty of DNS will be given if the competitor is not ready within 90 seconds. It is the competitor's responsibility to start their solve within that time.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The time will be tracked using a secondary stopwatch or phone that is visible to the competitor.</li>
        <li>The judge will start the timer once the cube cover is set and the runner has left the station.</li>
        <li>Extensions to this time limit will not be granted for typical crowd reactions or other normal disturbances.</li>
        <li>In extreme cases, such as a very large crowd reaction to a world record or similar, the competitor must immediately appeal to the judge if they want the timer reset. The appeal must then be approved by a Stage Lead. If approved, the timer will be reset to 60 seconds.</li>
        <li>For 3x3 Finals, the maximum preparation time permitted under this regulation is 60 seconds.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>3x3x3 Finals will be held head-to-head, with two competitors solving at a time, starting with the 7th and 8th seeds. Other competitors will remain in the green room until they are called to compete, to ensure fairness.</li>
    <li>After each round, there will be a designated area where competitors can go to validate their own scrambles if they would like (except for 6x6, 7x7, Megaminx, 5x5).</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Live Stream and Filming</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Filming and Photography will take place at the event. By entering the event premises, you acknowledge that you have been informed you may be photographed and recorded for media to be used in any format for any purpose worldwide in perpetuity by CubingUSA, the WCA, and their partners and representatives. Further, by your presence, you grant permission for your likeness and voice to be included therein without compensation, credit, or other consideration. If you do not wish to be photographed, recorded, or appear under these conditions, you should not enter the event premises.</li>
    <li>Some timers will be directly in front of a camera, or will have an overhead camera positioned above the competitor's head to capture the attempt from their perspective. These cameras will not physically interfere with the solving process. The organizing team reserves the right to determine which competitors' attempts will occur on these timers, either for one attempt or the entire average.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Extras and Distractions</h5>
  <p>
    We expect this to be an exciting, energetic event. We ask competitors to prepare for solving in this environment, as we will not award extra attempts for every distraction. We expect distractions to occur, including (but not limited to):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cheering for competitors achieving fast results, as well as spectators moving around the room to see those results.</li>
    <li>Competitors making noise after achieving a fast result.</li>
    <li>Routine announcements, such as calling the next group. We will keep announcements during blindfolded events to a bare minimum, and make them as short as possible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In situations like these, we will not award extra attempts for distractions. However, in more extreme situations, such as a physical distraction, lighting issues, or a large loud reaction from a competitor seated adjacent to you, we may award extras. This includes finals.
  </p>
  <p>
    If during an attempt you would like an extra, verbally inform your judge (by saying “extra”) immediately, but finish your solve under the assumption that it won’t be granted.
