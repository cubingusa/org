  <h3>Competition Policies</h3>
  <p>
    This page lists a number of competition policies which may differ from what you are used to at local competitions. Where applicable, the corresponding WCA policy will be linked.
  </p>
  <h5>Finals</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>During all final rounds, competitors may not interact with their phones from the start of the round until they have completed their solves (<a href="https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/external/Scramble%20Accountability.pdf" target="_blank">WSAP</a> 4.2).</li>
    <li>All finals on the main stage, except for 4x4x4 Blindfolded and 5x5x5 Blindfolded, will be stationary: you will remain at your timer from the beginning of your first solve until the end of your last solve.</li>
    <li>All finals on the main stage, except for 4x4x4 Blindfolded and 5x5x5 Blindfolded, will have live data entry. As such, competitors will be asked not to reset their timer immediately after their attempt, to give the data entry team time to record the result.</li>
    <li>During all final rounds on the main stage, competitors will need to start their attempt within one minute; this will be timed on a stopwatch by the judge (<a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#A3b1" target="_blank">Regulation A3b1</a>). Competitors who have a legitimate reason to need longer than one minute may request an exception to the WCA Delegate.</li>
    <li>We reserve the right to delay the beginning of an attempt in order to have competitors complete their attempts at a similar time.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>3x3x3 Finals</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>3x3x3 Finals will be held head-to-head, with eight matchups of two competitors, starting with the 15th and 16th seeds, and moving up to the 1st and 2nd seeds. Competitors will alternate their solves, starting with the even number seed.</li>
    <li>In order to ensure fairness, competitors will stay in a separate room between the start of the round and when they are called to compete. Competitors will not be permitted to interact with their phones during this time (<a href="https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/external/Scramble%20Accountability.pdf" target="_blank">WSAP</a> 4.2).</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>3x3x3 Semi-Finals</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Competitors will be stationary during the 3x3x3 Semi-Finals. Competitors should expect an environment similar to a Final Round during the 3x3x3 Semi-Finals.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Live Stream and Filming</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Filming and Photography will take place at the event. By entering the event premises, you acknowledge that you have been informed you may be photographed and recorded for media to be used in any format for any purpose worldwide in perpetuity by CubingUSA, the WCA, and their partners and representatives. Further, by your presence, you grant permission for your likeness and voice to be included therein without compensation, credit, or other consideration. If you do not wish to be photographed, recorded, or appear under these conditions, you should not enter the event premises.</li>
    <li>Some timers will be directly in front of a camera, or will have an overhead camera positioned above the competitor's head to capture the attempt from their perspective. The organizing team reserves the right to determine which competitors' attempts will occur on these timers, either for one attempt or the entire average.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Extras and Distractions</h5>
  <p>
    We expect the WCA World Championship 2025 to be an exciting, energetic event. We ask competitors to prepare for solving in this environment, as we will not award extra attempts for every distraction. We expect distractions to occur, including (but not limited to):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cheering for competitors achieving fast results, as well as spectators moving around the room to see those results.</li>
    <li>Competitors making noise after achieving a fast result.</li>
    <li>Routine announcements, such as calling the next group. We will keep announcements during blindfolded events to a bare minimum, and make them as short as possible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In situations like these, we will not award extra attempts for distractions. However, in more extreme situations, such as a physical distraction, lighting issues, or a large loud reaction from a competitor seated adjacent to you, we may award extras.
  </p>
  <p>
    We encourage you to practice solving under distracting conditions, and to experiment with distraction-reducing tools such as (non-electronic) headphones or blinders.
