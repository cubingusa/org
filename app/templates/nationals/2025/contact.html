      {% call faq.faq_item("Why is the format different from usual?", "why") %}
        Because CubingUSA is organizing Rubik's WCA World Championship 2025, we did not feel it was feasible to also organize a large convention-style Nationals in the same year. We felt this was the perfect opportunity to experiment with a competition format 
      {% endcall %}
      {% call faq.faq_item("Is the competition open to non-US competitors?", "intl") %}
        Per WCA policies, any competitor may register for this competition. However, we ask international competitors not to register for this competition, as we want to make sure that top US competitors have a fair opportunity for the title of US National Champion. CubingUSA is giving up our usual National Championship in 2025 in order to organize World Championship for the global community; we ask that international competitors wishing to participate in a US competition do so at
        either Rubik's WCA World Championship 2025 or CubingUSA Nationals 2026 instead.

        International competitors will not be recognized during the award ceremony. In addition, the livestream and commentary will focus on US competitors.

      {% call faq.faq_item("Will this format be used for CubingUSA Nationals 2026?", "2026") %}
        No. CubingUSA Nationals 2026 will return to our typical convention-style competition format.
      {% endcall %}
      {% call faq.faq_item("How does advancement work?", "advancement") %}
        The top 8 US competitors will advance to the finals of each event, in addition to any international competitors who place ahead of the 8th US competitor. Similarly, the top 16 US competitors will advance to the 3x3 Semifinals.
