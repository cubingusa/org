  <h3>Rubik's WCA World Championship 2025 Schedule</h3>
  <p>
    The final schedule is available at the <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/WC2025#competition-schedule">WCA website</a>. We may make minor adjustments to the exact start and end times of events between now and the start of the competition, however no major changes will be made. Competitors will receive their personal schedules, including group assignments, in early June.
  </p>
  <p>
    Competitors must check in before their first event. Check-in will be open starting at <strong>8:00 AM</strong> on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. You do not need to check in on Thursday if you do not have any events on Thursday.
