  <h3>Rubik's WCA World Championship 2025 Schedule</h3>
  <p>
  The final schedule is available at the <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/WC2025#competition-schedule">WCA website</a>. You can find your personal group schedule on <a href="https://cubingusa.org/groups">CompetitionGroups</a>. Please take note of whether your group is on the <b>Main Stage</b> (Hall 4EF), or the <b>Side Stage</b> (Hall 4AB). These are two separate rooms, and we will only make announcements about groups in
  the room where they take place.
  </p>
  <p>
    Group assignments for later rounds will be posted on CompetitionGroups throughout the competition. In the event that you have a conflict between a later round and a first round group, we will move you to a different group for the first round, and notify you of this by email. In addition, we will list affected competitors on this page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Competitors must check in before their first event. Check-in will be open starting at <strong>8:00 AM</strong> on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. You do not need to check in on Thursday if you do not have any events on Thursday.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides the competition, we'll have plenty of other excitement throughout the week:
